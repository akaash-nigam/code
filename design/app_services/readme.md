1. Design a chat Application?
2. Design a Google Search?
3. Architect a World Wide video Distribution System?
4. Design the content search autocomplete feature on Kindle?
5. How do we achieve google news personalization?
6. Design Uber or Lyft like architecture keeping scale, latency and availability in mind. The design can be at macro level first, that is, major components like persistent store (SQL/NoSQL/redundant), cache, communication/messaging. The design and if time permits, details will then be discussed/challenged.
7. Design a push notification system for android. Assume that we have 1 million users this year, but next year we will have 15 million. Assume that Google can handle infinite notifications per second.Identify different services. Make all those services scalable by adding more nodes.
8. Design an email sender, need to send 10000000 emails and you have 5 machines.  how could you do efficiently. 
9. Given an URL you need to analyze all the images( they may be in 1000’s of number) and return the cumulative quality of images present in that url.  lets say: you can configure image quality as very good, good, average, poor..etc, so you have to return one value among them.The given URL may contain several other URLs and they also contain lot of images . you need to consider all of them. lot of questions like how to avoid visiting same url again,  how would you determine the quality of an image if you encounter an url that contains only an image..etc.
10. n an online teaching system, there are n number of teachers and each one teaches only one subject to any number of students. And a student can join to any number of teachers to learn those subjects.  And each student can give one preference through which he can get updates about the subject or class timings etc.  Those preferences can be through SMS or twitter/facebook or email..etc.  Design above system and draw the diagram for above.This was a design question, discuss data structures/ complexities, etc. 
11. Design IMBDB
12. Design a Card Game?
13. They described a card game that can be played by two people or by one person against a computer and asked me to code it in Java.
14. Check to see if a binary tree was mirrored Other DS/Algo questions
15. How would you design the complete architecture for image storage of Amazon.com storage? Another one was, how would you design a key-value store? I hadn't worked with a lot of big distributed applications so I struggled with these two. I had prepared a lot for the on-site, but the questions were a lot different than the phone interview questions, which mostly focused on small scale algorithms.
16. Something about merging sorted list? 
17. I was asked to implement a cache for storing visited webpages, including some sort of deletion algorithm if the maximum sized was achieved.


MyApproach:

Is it complete application design?
1. User Interfaces and services they will need. 
A. User Interface that will be interacting with the services. 
    B. The Services.
    C. Database configuration there.    
    You are to write a spell checker. Discuss the API, Data Structures and Algorithms.
