1. Number of 1's in binary representation of integer?
2. List all anagrams in a file. Assumptions: case-insensitive, a-z characters only, one word per line. For example, if the file contains dog, cat, ddd, goo, act, god -- output dog, god, act, cat
3. If you have a file containing millions of integers, how would you sort the data in the file using extremely limited resources, such a s 1GB of memory?
4.
