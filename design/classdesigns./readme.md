Is it class design?
1. Class Design, Encapsulation, Hierarchy. 
2. Design Elevator system. And then write an algorithm for that Design such that, the user request should be completed in logN time in a N story building with M elevators.

Identify class encapsulation. 
Hierarchy etc. 
1. Design a restaurant reservation system - You need to design everything from scratch - Identify actors in the system, identify what all data should be stored in persistence storage (and why). How would you make your design scalable?
2. Design a data structure which could perform the following operations in O(1):  getRandom() should pick a "random" element from your data structure, and should not be predictable (for instance always picking the "first" element from your DS)
3. Design and implement traffic control system, also include pedestrian signal management as part of this solution.
