Bucket Sort. 
Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number ofbuckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort, and is a cousin of radix sort in the most to least significant digit flavour. Bucket sort is a generalization of pigeonhole sort. Bucket sort can be implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be 
considered a comparison sort algorithm. The computational complexity estimates involve the number of buckets.

function bucketSort(array, n) is
  buckets ‚Üê new array of n empty lists
  for i = 0 to (length(array)-1) do
    insert array[i] into buckets[msbits(array[i], k)]
  for i = 0 to n - 1 do
    nextSort(buckets[i]);
  return the concatenation of buckets[0], ...., buckets[n-1]
